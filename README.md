INTRODUCTION
------------

Acquia Lift lets you track customers' behavior throughout their buying journey —
from anonymous visitor to loyal, repeat customer — by creating a unified
customer profile for each individual. Using Acquia Lift, you can now bring
together content and customer data from any channel to personalize customers'
experiences across websites regardless of the content management system that you
use. Acquia Lift adaptively segments your customers in real-time, letting you
deliver personalized content that furthers your website visitors' engagement
with your brand.

The latest stable releases can be found on [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/acquia_lift/releases).
Please contact your Acquia Solution Architect or Account Manager, and they will
be happy to help you with on-boarding.
